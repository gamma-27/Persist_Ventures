# Market Maker Bot for Solana

This repository contains a **Market Maker Bot** that interacts with the **Solana blockchain**. The bot is designed to simulate automated market making, executing buy and sell transactions to add volume, minimize volatility, offer strategic selling, and create profit. The bot can be used for testing and experimentation in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments.

## Features

- **Automated SOL Distribution**: Distributes SOL to multiple wallets.
- **Volume Generation**: Adds large buy orders to simulate market activity and liquidity.
- **Minimizing Volatility**: Automatically executes sell orders to reduce significant price spikes caused by buy orders.
- **Strategic Selling**: Helps teams sell tokens without negatively impacting market prices, ensuring a smooth and controlled price rise.
- **Profit Generation**: The bot trades to optimize profit based on market conditions, executing buy and sell orders strategically.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following:

1. **Solana Wallet**: You must have a Solana wallet and private key for authentication.
2. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file to configure API keys and wallet information. 
3. **Python 3.x** and **Node.js**: Ensure that you have Python and Node.js installed on your machine.

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and configure the following:

```
HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_api_key
SHYFT_API_KEY=your_shyft_api_key
RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY=your_wallet_public_key
RPC_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT=your_rpc_websocket_endpoint
```

### Install Dependencies

You will need to install Python dependencies for interacting with the Solana blockchain and managing transactions.

1. Install Python dependencies (for balance checks and transaction logic):

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies (for running the volume and profit scripts):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Script Configuration

### Volume Script Configuration

Configure the following parameters in the `volume.js` script before running it:

```javascript
export const DISTRIBUTION_AMOUNT = 0.01;
export const DISTRIBUTION_NUM = 3;
export const BUY_AMOUNT = 0.01;
export const BUY_UPPER_AMOUNT = 0.002;
export const BUY_LOWER_AMOUNT = 0.001;
export const BUY_INTERVAL_MAX = 4000;
export const BUY_INTERVAL_MIN = 2000;
export const TOTAL_TRANSACTION = 20;
```

### Profit Script Configuration

Configure the following parameters in the `profit.js` script before running it:

```javascript
export const MIN_TOKEN_AMOUNT = 1000;
export const MIN_SOL_BALANCE = 10;
export const MIN_SOL_BALANCE_EXCLUSIVE = 5;
export const MIN_TOKEN_AMOUNT_EXCLUSIVE = 500;
export const AUTO_SELL = true;
export const ENABLE_AUTO_SELL_PROFIT = true;
export const ENABLE_AUTO_SELL_LOSS = true;
export const AUTO_SELL_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE = 10;
export const AUTO_SELL_LOSS_PERCENTAGE = 20;
export const PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL = 5000;
export const OPEN_TRADE_EXPIRATION_TIME = 3600000;
```

## How to Run the Scripts

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-maker-bot.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd market-maker-bot
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    For Python:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For Node.js:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Configure the `.env` file with your API keys, wallet information, and RPC URL.

5. Run the **volume** script to simulate market-making transactions:

    ```bash
    npm run volume
    ```

6. Run the **profit** script to manage profits and losses automatically:

    ```bash
    npm run profit
    ```

7. To monitor wallet balance changes:

    ```bash
    python monitor_balance.py
    ```

## Example Use Case

This bot can be used to automate trading strategies and simulate market-making behavior on the **Solana** blockchain. It is particularly useful for projects and teams looking to manage token liquidity, mitigate volatility, or optimize the timing of token sales.

### Key Functions:
- **Automated Token Distribution**: The bot distributes SOL across multiple wallets to create artificial volume.
- **Automated Buying and Selling**: Performs automated buying and selling transactions to simulate market-making.
- **Profit Optimization**: The bot tracks token price movements and executes profit-taking or loss-prevention strategies based on user-defined settings.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that your wallet address is valid and in the **base58** format.
- If you encounter errors like "Invalid param: Invalid", double-check your environment variables and ensure you are using the correct RPC URL.
- Check that the Solana blockchain is accessible at the provided RPC endpoint and that your wallet has sufficient funds.
